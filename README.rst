hackerrank
==========

A collection of HackerRank_ problems solved for interview prep or as exercises.

I hate doing these since the problems are contrived and encourage sloppy
programming habits but the reality is that too many companies use coding tests
for initial screenings so these are a necessary hardship. However, I will
concede that like in the classroom setting, contrived problems limited in scope
do provide some educational value.

This repo serves as a way to incentivize myself to persist with such
teeth-pulling via commit history gamification as well as to make it easier to
perform local debugging of large test cases. One cannot run their debugger of
choice on the HackerRank problem pages and some HackerRank inputs exceed the
size limited imposed on uploaded custom inputs.

TBD for building. Maybe I should try *not* doing these in C++.
