hackerrank
==========

A collection of HackerRank_ problems solved for interview prep or as exercises.

I hate doing these since the problems are contrived and encourage sloppy
programming habits but the reality is that too many companies use coding tests
for initial screenings so these are a necessary hardship. I will, however,
concede that like in the classroom setting, contrived problems limited in scope
are useful ways to introduce applications of previously learned concepts.

This repo serves as a way to incentivize myself to persist with such
teeth-pulling via commit history gamification as well as to make it easier to
perform local debugging of large test cases since some HackerRank inputs exceed
the limit allowed for custom inputs.

TBD for building. Maybe I should try *not* doing these in C++.
